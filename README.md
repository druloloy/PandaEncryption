# Panda Encryption
Panda encryption is a modified Viginere Cipher. Panda Encryption uses Fisher-Yates shuffle to jumble the cipher text which adds more security to it. 
The shuffler uses a sequence of Pseudo-Random numbers (using [seedrandom](https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom/blob/released/seedrandom.js) by David Bau)
